      shortDescription: "Voice-first AI dating assistant that creates authentic connections through natural conversations, moving beyond traditional dating apps to foster meaningful relationships.",
      fullDescription: "**What is Archie?** Archie is an AI-powered dating confidante designed to guide users toward meaningful, long-term connections. Operating as a simple phone number for calls and texts, Archie represents a fundamental shift from traditional dating apps by fostering authenticity through natural conversations. No app download required â€“ just genuine, voice-first interactions with a friendly, empathetic AI that's slightly playful and always supportive. **Profile Creation & Understanding** Archie builds comprehensive user profiles through 7-8 minute phone calls, gathering insights about personality, interests, dating preferences, and future goals without typing pressure. The AI continuously learns from conversations and date feedback, capturing behavioral insights including routines, habits, values, and lifestyle details for better matching. **Smart Matching Process** Using relationship science research, Archie considers factors like mutual connections, education, location, and user intent to predict real-life chemistry. Matches are introduced individually via detailed text messages explaining compatibility factors, with a double opt-in system ensuring mutual interest before introductions. **24/7 Support & Coaching** Available around the clock for post-match support, date planning assistance, and personalized coaching. Archie helps users discuss potential matches, gathers feedback to refine the algorithm, and provides insights after each interaction to improve future dating experiences. **Proven Results & User Feedback** During beta testing, Archie facilitated successful matches with 70% profile completion rates and 8.7-minute average call durations. Users described conversations as 'very natural' and 'strangely comfortable,' with high engagement and anticipation for matches. The platform addresses dating app fatigue by eliminating appearance-based swiping and fostering authentic connections in a judgment-free environment.",

      shortDescription: "Open-source voice cloning and AI chatbot platform that creates digital twins with zero-shot voice synthesis and intelligent knowledge bases using RAG architecture.",
      fullDescription: "ImprintAI addresses the high cost barrier of commercial voice cloning solutions (Resemble AI: $700+, 11Labs: $1300+) by leveraging cutting-edge open-source models. The platform combines ChatterboxTTS for zero-shot voice synthesis with Stella EN 1.5B embeddings for intelligent document retrieval, creating a comprehensive AI persona system. The architecture implements Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable context-aware responses from uploaded documents, supporting multiple file formats (PDF, DOC, TXT). Key technical achievements include sub-200ms voice generation on GPU hardware, 44.1kHz audio quality output, and integration of a 1.5B parameter embedding model with an industry-leading MTEB score of 64.4. The system requires only 3-5 seconds of audio input for accurate voice cloning and includes personality configuration capabilities for custom AI persona creation. The full-stack implementation uses FastAPI for backend services, React with TypeScript for the frontend, and ChromaDB for vector-based document storage and retrieval. This project demonstrates the feasibility of democratizing voice AI technology through open-source alternatives while maintaining professional-grade performance standards.",

      shortDescription: "Research and development of structural color replication inspired by natural organisms, combining biology and nanotechnology for potential applications in sensors, displays, and photovoltaics.",
      fullDescription: "Structural color, where vibrant colors are produced through nanostructures instead of pigments, has been researched in artistic and scientific communities. Many biological species have developed structural properties that assist in camouflage, send warning signals, attract mates, regulate body temperature, etc. Structural color showcases the remarkable ingenuity of biological systems in achieving vivid and iridescent colors using limited materials. In contrast to humans, who have an extensive array of pigments and dyes at their disposal, nature employs a relatively small set of 'building blocks' to create an astonishing variety of colors. The study of natural structural color holds immense potential for inspiring and advancing nanotechnologies in the field of nanophotonics. The applications to medical solutions, optical sensing, communication, and even defense are broad and promising. By understanding the intricate mechanisms behind natural structural coloration, scientists can gain insights into designing and fabricating artificial nanostructures that exhibit desired optical properties. This interdisciplinary approach, combining biology and nanotechnology will pave the way for innovation in these fields of sensors, displays, and photovoltaics, among others.",

As the only non-data science major in the class, I faced a steep learning curve, but the opportunity to work with robots made the process enjoyable. After weeks of acquiring the necessary skills, my team was given the freedom to choose our own project. We decided to focus on implementing an object detection model to identify cars on the track. Our aim was to enhance our robot's capabilities by enabling it to identify and track other cars, allowing it to plan its route effectively, avoid collisions, and potentially even overtake competing vehicles.",

The project advances your knowledge by integrating multiple cutting-edge fields - combining nanophotonics principles (UCN light conversion mechanisms), neuroscience (epilepsy pathophysiology and hippocampal circuitry), optogenetics (ChR2 channel function and AAV gene delivery), and biomedical engineering (transcranial stimulation and EEG monitoring). Through designing this three-phase experimental approach, you developed understanding of how photon upconversion can overcome the limited tissue penetration of blue light, learned about targeting specific neural circuits (KCNQ2/3 channels) for therapeutic intervention, and gained insight into translating nanotechnology applications from in vitro phantom models to in vivo animal studies. This project particularly enhanced your grasp of how optical properties of nanomaterials can be engineered to solve clinical challenges, bridging fundamental photonics concepts with practical medical applications in a way that demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of modern biomedical research.",
